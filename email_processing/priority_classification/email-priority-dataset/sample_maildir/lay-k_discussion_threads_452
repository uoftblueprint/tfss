The Chronicle is developing a front page story  based on a Garnett Coleman 
idea to change state law to allow Sports Authority  tax funds to go to fund 
public hospitals.
?
It is my judgement that this story and the spin  afterwards could easily 
shave 10 points off our yes #'s and make this a  horserace again.
?
It is even worse than the stealth tax increase in  '96 because it cuts to the 
heart of voters' objections to the funding of sports  facilities. And it 
takes away our reponse that this money cannot legally ever be  used to fund 
hospitals or education. This was the basis of their successful  attack in 
'99---only this time we don't have any real response.
?
The Chronicle has delayed this story for  one day.
?
I won't waste your time reviewing the various  things we have done to spin 
this better. We have done many things. But it is  like putting bandaids on a 
gaping chest wound.
?
Could you call Jack Loftis or Sweeney at  the Chronicle? We need to downplay 
it or kill it. I have more info if you want to  talk---713-851-2576.
