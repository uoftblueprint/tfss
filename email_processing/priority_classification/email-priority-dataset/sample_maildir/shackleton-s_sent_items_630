Stacey Richardson has requested copies of the following docs which are in my office files:

(1)  BMO Nesbitt Burns Corp. repo agreement

(2)  HSBC Futures agreement

We can send via interoffice mail to Stacey at 2127b.

I may stop by the eye doctor in the a.m. (Thurs.) to pick up my glasses so I should be here before 9am.

Thanks for your help.
