As I expected, there were many changes to be made to the call list. I think I have everything updated correctly based on the feedback I received. Here is a revised version of the List. If you see anything else that needs changed or added, please let me know. There were a couple of groups that I did not hear anything back. If I receive any additional changes, I will revise the list again. Thanks for your help and patience.

Randy
