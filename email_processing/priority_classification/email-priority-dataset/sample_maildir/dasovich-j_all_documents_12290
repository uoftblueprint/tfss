1) if he's got 30 minutes, then he should join for 30 minutes.
2) quite urgent, since the analysis needs to be done pronto.
3) if he can't join, that's ok.  we can fill him after the meeting.

Linda called for Steffes re: your inquiry about a conference call on 
Core/non-core -- he *might* be available 
@ 8 AM PDT/10 Central......tentatively -- would that work for you?? 

Let me know ASAP, so I can call her back....

Thanks,
Joseph
