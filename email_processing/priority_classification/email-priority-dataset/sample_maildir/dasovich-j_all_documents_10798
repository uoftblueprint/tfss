The WGA documents are in draft form and are not for circulation.  They are 
only for Gov. Rocicot's use.

Also, do you know whether CISCO is for or against the San Jose plant to be 
built by Calpine?

Greeatings Tom:

I'm looking at hard copies of documents titled:

Emergency Measures for Western Power Markets
Possible Western electricity emergency plan elements


Could you send me electronic versions?  Much appreciated.  I'll get back to 
you with more siting information (per your email) on Monday.

Best,
Jeff
