Due to the increased number of conference calls we are having, it has become necessary to have this bridge line more available for our use.  This makes a change necessary but only on the dial in number.  The pass code will remain the same.  Please make note of the new dial in numbers.  This will pertain to our weekday (7:15 a.m. CST) calls as well as other future calls.
