??????? Brian - This is a  copy of an emergency petition to modify the gas 
accord decision that was filed  yesterday.? It basically requests that 
penalties to core customers for  diversions be waived and any diversion be 
priced at the market price up to $50  per dth.? Unfortunately, we felt it had 
to be filed because we couldn't let  the core be exposed to $100 per Dth gas 
supply when PG&E can't buy at $10  per dth.? Hopefully, the crisis will be 
resolved and petition will have no  bearing.? 

??????? It was mailed to the  Gas Accord service list and our legal division 
e-mailed to an unknown service  list which I had wished they hadn't done. (We 
are not trying to add to any  problem, but based on a worst case scenario we 
couldn't have the core exposed to  buying $100 per dth gas for all its gas 
supply)???
