As you are probably aware, the Commission, at the pre-hearing conference on
October 26, rejected the utilities proposals to roll a bunch of related
issues into addressing their undercollection issue.  At this point, it
doesn't appear as though there will be hearings.  However, we do have to
file comments by November 9 on the utilities claims (taking, violation of
the filed rate doctrine, etc) and TURN's proposal.  TURN proposed to fold
the undercollected balance into the TCBA and let nature take its course
through the end of the transition period.

Our comments will go toward supporting TURN, in concept, refuting utility
claims of taking.  We may want to consider teeing up some of the ideas of
an equitable allocation of high costs to ratepayers.

Let me know your thoughts, who else will want to weigh in on this.
