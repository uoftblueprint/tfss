Sorry for the rescheduling.  Shalesh is unable to make it until late this 
afternoon.  Since what we have is informal and not urgent, perhaps we can 
catch you for a few minutes just sometime late today or tomorrow before you 
leave.  Otherwise, it can wait until you return.

Thanks,
Martin

Shalesh and I wanted to meet with you briefly, but this morning's timing 
isn't working out.  Are you available this afternoon, sometime after 5pm?

Thanks,
Martin
