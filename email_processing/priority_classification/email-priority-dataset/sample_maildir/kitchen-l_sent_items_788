I'm fine - don't worry.  Can you send a note out to all assistants making sure they all get the money back from AStros playoff tickets.

Tina very ill in St Lukes Emergency Room with possible heart attack.

Hi Louise,
 
I apologize for being out today-I hope you are okay  with it.  I've been really sick to my stomach since yesterday afternoon and  can't manage to stay out of the bathroom.  If you need anything please let  me know.
 
I hope you had a good weekend.
 
Tammie
