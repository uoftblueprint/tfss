Shelly,

Is there any way you could give me a little more information regarding the 
times of the presentations for each of the respective schools.

Thanks,
Susan

Analysts:

Your participation is being requested. The schools originally identified for 
technology recruiting have received a large amount of interest in the  
Analyst Program.  Therefore additional coverage is necessary, to attend 
presentations,  at the schools listed below:

October 3 -   Minnesota
October 11 - Carnegie Melon
October 12 - NYU
October 16 - Berkeley

Obviously, we are running on a tight time line.  Your urgent response to this 
request is greatly appreciated.  Once your attendance is confirmed details 
will follow.  Please respond to Shelly Jones via email.


Thank you for your support.
Shelly Jones
Manager, Analyst Recruiting
