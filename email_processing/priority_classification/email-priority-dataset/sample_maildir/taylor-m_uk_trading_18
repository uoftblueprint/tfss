Per my voicemail to you, in order to allow the OMLX to install the 
telecommunications link for the screen etc., they will need at least the last 
page of the OMNet Agreement signed and sent to them by fax tomorrow.  As soon 
as Susan sends me the execution copies by e-mail I shall forward them to you.

However, if you are able to have at least the OMNet Agreement signed by 
tomorrow, please could you then fax it to:-

Susan Gill
Lawyer
OM London Exchange

Tel.:  0171-815-8510

Fax:  0171-815-8508

Kind regards
