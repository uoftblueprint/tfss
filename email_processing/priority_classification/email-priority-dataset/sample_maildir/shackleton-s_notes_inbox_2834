Samantha Boyd had a death in her family early this morning and I do not know 
when she will return to work.  I do not know her computer password she is 
working on time sensitive documents with correspondence being done through 
email.  Please reset her computer password and lotus notes password so I may 
access the correspondence.  Please notify me of the new passwords.

Thank you,
