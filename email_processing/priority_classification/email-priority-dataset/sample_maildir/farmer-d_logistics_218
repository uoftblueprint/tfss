Ed has requested that we compile a list this morning of all parties/points which we owe gas to, in the event that we need to find a home for excess volumes today.  Please email me a list of any meters/contracts that you are aware of.  I am compiling an interim list based upon the RTU variance report for March, however, I don't want to rely on this list as you may be engaged in balancing at meters with variances.

Thank you,

Mary
