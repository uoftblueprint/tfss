Market Participants,

Several market participants have been engaged in a practice of scheduling
large amounts of non-firm counter flows on congested branch groups in order
to earn hour-ahead congestion revenues and then not providing those counter
flows in real time.  This occurred during a Stage 1 emergency on 7-20-00.
This practice creates a significant reliability problem for the ISO and is
to the detriment of market efficiency.

This notice is intended to inform Market Participants that the ISO
Department of Market Analysis considers this a potentially serious "gaming"
practice as defined in the ISO Tariff MMIP 2.1.3. The ISO DMA will be
investigating any Market Participant found to be engaging in this activity
and will take appropriate corrective actions.
