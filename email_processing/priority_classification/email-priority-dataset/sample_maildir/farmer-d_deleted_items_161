	 When a disaster strikes who is going to take care of your family?  Experts warn that you must be prepared to be on your own for a minimum  of three-days after a disaster. City, state, and national emergency personnel  will be overwhelmed. They may not be able to respond immediately. Their  ability to reach you and your family may be severely hindered by the disaster.  You must be able to care for yourself during these critical 72 hours.  For this purpose we have prepared a  complete Disaster Recovery Kit.
