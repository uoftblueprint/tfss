Through the course of the year 22 people have been identified by east power 
as the key to their real time group.  No request will be granted on an 
emergency basis but will go through the usual process of getting facts and 
checking with me.  Another thing is that I don't know why we are not doing 
these things in conjunction with PRC so late in the year.
