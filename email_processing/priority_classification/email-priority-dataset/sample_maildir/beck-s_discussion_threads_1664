We really need to develop a plan for the group.  Attached is the plan I 
prepared last year - we can use this as a starting point.  

Keith - I am going to let you take the lead on this, as it will be critical 
that our customers can reach us no matter where we are....  We can then 
discuss PCG functions that are critical to ongoing ops in case of an 
emergency.   

Let's discuss more next week once Phase 2 is launched and things settle 
down.  However, it is imperative that we develop a plan as quickly as 
possible - this tropical storm could have very easily hit Houston, and we do 
not have anything in place at the moment.

Thanks
Sheri
