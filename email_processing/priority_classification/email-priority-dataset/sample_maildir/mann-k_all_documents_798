Is he availabe tomorrow?

Once you get a picture of availability (maybe you have it all ready), ask 
Sheila what she wants to do. She may want to re-schedule for tomorrow morning.

Subject: GE Meeting Today

Scott Dieball isn't available today.  Is he key, or should we try for 
tomorrow?  I didn't know how urgent the meeting was.
