I talked to Mark Taylor this am and he indicated that he is comfortable if an 
Enron Attorney has reviewed the non disclosure and would talk to Tana.  Tana 
please call me once you have confirmed with Mark so that Doug can send the 
agreement back to Eastman.  Thanks

Tana:

Would greatly appreciate your urgent review. The CIO of Eastman hopes to 
visit Houston on the 24th or 25th, pending the conclusion of the 
Nondisclosure Agreement,  to take our discussions to the next level of detail.

If you have any questions, please call me at X-37377.


Doug
