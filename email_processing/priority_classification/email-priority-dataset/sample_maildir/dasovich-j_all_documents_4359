Attached are? summaries of three recent SDG&E advice  letters.? AL1272-E may 
be of interest.? Also, SDG&E sent out today  an AL 1228-G, which is described 
in the cover email as, "Emergency Advice Letter  To Amortize An 
Overcollection Of Approximately $11 Million In The GSPBA To Core  
Customers."? However, the attachment is 28 blank pages!? I wrote  SDG&E early 
this morning asking for a copy which could be read, but have not  yet heard 
back from them.? Will let you know when it comes in.
