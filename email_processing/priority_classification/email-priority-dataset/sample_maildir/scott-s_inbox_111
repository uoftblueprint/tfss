hello girls- haven't heard from either of you in a while, and was hoping
y'all were ok.  was supposed to be on a flight back to houston this morning,
but obvioulsy that's off now.  just got bk from france late mon night- had
lots of fun, race was ok, but looooong.  triped on harry potter's cape and
had to go in ambulance to emergency room to get x-rays on my arm at the
finish line.  quel surpris- sustain injury to my arm while running a
marathon.  ok- am off.  just wanted to make sure you guys were alive and
well and i haven't been blacklisted....
