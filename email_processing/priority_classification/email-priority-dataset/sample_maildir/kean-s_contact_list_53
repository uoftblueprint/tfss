I am trying to update the Facilities Emergency Contact List. I know that much and possibly most of the list is no longer current. Please review for your department and send me any changes that are needed at your earliest convenience. In most cases we were carrying 4 names per group for emergencies. We are going to at least try to get two current contacts. If you know of any groups that may be completely gone, please let me know that also. Please do not make changes directly to the spreadsheet. 

Thanks,
Randy
