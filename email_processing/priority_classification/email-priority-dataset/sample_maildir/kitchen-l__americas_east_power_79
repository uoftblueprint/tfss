I HEARD THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE THAT EL PASO HAD AN EMERGENCY BOD MEETING ON FRIDAY.  THEY DID.  THERE IS SOME TYPE OF RETRADE UNDERWAY FROM THE BILL WISE LEVEL.  THEIR LEAD WON'T TELL ME OVER THE PHONE BUT WE ARE SCHEDULED TO GET TOGETHER AT LUNCH TO DISCUSS.  HE SAYS HE HAS SOME IDEAS.  COULD BE A RANGE OF THINGS BUT HE SEEMS TO BE NOTING TIMING (MAYBE THEY ARE TAPPED OUT FOR CASH).

DID NOT TAKE THE CHANCE TO TELL ABOUT THE OUTAGE.  WILL REVEAL AS APPROP.

DAVE - PLEASE CALL LARRY AND FIND OUT WHAT IS UP BEFORE I SPEAK WITH DAVID FIELD

JOE HENRY - COULD YOU PLEASE DO THE SAME WITH ANDREW.  

I'm AVAILABLE BY CELL WHEN YOU GET DATA POINTS.
