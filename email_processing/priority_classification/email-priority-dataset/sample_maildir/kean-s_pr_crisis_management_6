Attached is the current emergency contact list for the Houston Enron facilities. These are the numbers and contact people that will be used by Security and other Facility Services groups to contact people during an emergency involving one of the facilities in the Houston Area. We depend on the people on the list and the people copied on it's distribution to keep us supplied with current information. Please take a few minutes to review the list and insure that the information concerning your area or department is correct. If changes are needed, please do not make changes to the spread sheet. Forward the changes to me via e-mail, and please reference the line number that needs to be changed.

Your help and cooperation is appreciated.

Thanks,
Randy
