Dear, Directors and Auditors of SK-Enron

At the 4th meeting of Board of Directors held on 22nd, May, the Directors and
Auditor present there have disscussed the disposition of Ildong country club
membership of SK Gas, but it was not resolved. However, it needs an urgent
motion due to the nature of deal.
Please find the minutes attached, and make sure whether you, Directors approve
it or not by this return e-mail as soon as possible.

Best Regards,

Kim Gil Hyung
