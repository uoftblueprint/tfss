I am compiling two "Top Ten Lists" to roast Cliff Baxter at his farewell 
dinner tomorrow evening (Top Ten Reasons We HATE To See Cliff Leave and Top 
Ten Reasons We Are GLAD To See Cliff Leave).  I need your input ASAP to 
compile the lists.  Please respond to this e:mail with anything funny or 
incriminating about Cliff.

Thanks for your help.

Ken
