Hey, just wanted to clarify the capping in the new order--

--During non-emergency hours, the region-wide cap is at 85% of the highest price bid during the last Stage 1 emergency.

--During emergency hours, the price mitigation rules are the same--based on the operating costs of the least-efficient generator

Good to chat with you this morning, I hope that things start to look up soon!  I'll keep my fingers crossed.
