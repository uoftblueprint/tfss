Christi said that Dan should work on this because he knows the history.  Jim 
approved it. Can you give me a budget amount?  Thanks.

CalISO filed a tariff to charge scheduling coordinators FERC's annual
charge.  The ISO should charge end users (transmission customers).  As you
know we just got FERC to rule that marketers don't have to pay the annual
charges.  Tim wants to protest.  Protests due 1/19!  Please respond ASAP.
