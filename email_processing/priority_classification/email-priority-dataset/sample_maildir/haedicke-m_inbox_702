Attached please a write up of the transactions/dispositions currently underway that may require consent for completion from Dynegy or, in some cases, consent for continuing discussions. All of these are very urgent as they give the possibility to raise cash - please call me to discuss (01144 7887 660 817) if you have any questions.
Thanks, Marcus
