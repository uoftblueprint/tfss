APACHI management has been successful in delaying for at least two weeks the 
signing of a renegotiated agreement for phase II of the Lagos State project, 
a 548 megawatt power plant.  This is part of the PPA that was originally 
signed and publicized in December 1999. Per our discussions, we sought a 
delay in the signing from this week to avoid undue publicity as a result of 
President Clinton's visit to Nigeria on August 26 and 27. 

There is still a risk that the Governor of Lagos may talk about the project, 
but we expect most reports to focus on the phase I emergency power barges and 
do not anticipate significant publicity about phase II.  Furthermore, Habiba 
has carefully developed an agreement on statements and minimal publicity with 
NEPA and other government agencies, which should mitigate any leaks.

Attached are the statement and Q&As we plan to use after the signing.
