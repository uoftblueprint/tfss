This message is for all employees in California and New York:

For all who have submitted their disability ballots, thank you!  

There are still a few of you who have not returned your ballot to elect 
either the State Disability program or the GE Disability program.  Do not 
call HR and ask if you are one who did not submit a ballot.  If you are 
unsure whether or not you submitted a ballot, chances are you did not.

We need your ballot immediately!  This issue is now critical.  Please submit 
by end of business Wednesday, July 10th.

For your convenience, a ballot is attached.
