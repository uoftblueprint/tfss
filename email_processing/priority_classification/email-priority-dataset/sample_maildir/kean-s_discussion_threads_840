Steve:

I have slightly revised the talking points to incorporate the concept of FERC 
jurisdiction over reliability and to note that there are procedural options 
for DOE and/or FERC  --  actions that can be taken immediately (DOE emergency 
authority) and longer-term solutions (the CRT or Petition for Rulemaking).
