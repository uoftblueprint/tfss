The request to have all currently performing deals moved to the East Performance and West Performance books has just been expressed as URGENT.  

As soon as the East Performance and West Performance books are set up in Global, we will need Enpower refreshed ASAP.  

Bill H. is coordinating the setup in global, Dave/Crooks are coordinating the script to be run to change the primary desk name.  

If anyone has any questions at all, PLEASE let me know.  Thanks to all and sorry for the fire drill!
