Attached is the EES contact list for next week.  I will be calling in for the 
meeting next week, but Scott Stoness and Evan Hughes will be facilitating the 
meeting for me.  Should the time of the call conflict with your need to 
prepare or attend the CPUC meetings next week, please call Evan Hughes 
(713-345-3311).  Evan will be in the office all next week.  

I am also trying to collect the contact numbers for Rick Buy, Mark Palmer and 
Mark Koenig and will forward them to you in a separate notice.  

Thanks,
Wanda Curry
