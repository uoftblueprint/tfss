Fred, I am following up with you on this matter with you for two reasons:

1.	Generally, I would like to know your status of your memo outlining the scope of the regulatory requirements for our trading business, if any; and

2.	Specifically, and more urgently, but somewhat related to this matter, we have a specific issue which relates to a new product we are offering on Enron OnLine and potential regulatory implications for Enron OnLine and our arrangement with NGX, whereby Alberta fixed price natural gas transactions completed on Enron OnLine are included with NGX to establish the Alberta Gas Price Index.

Would you kindly give me a call at your earliest convenience?  As I say, I would like to get an update on the matter generally, but more urgently, we would like your advice in connection with this new specific product offering.

Regards,

Peter C.M. Keohane
