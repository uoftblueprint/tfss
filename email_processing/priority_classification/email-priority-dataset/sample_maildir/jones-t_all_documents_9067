Stephanie - As discussed, please shut down all Duke entities immediately for 
all CAISO products on EOL. I have cleared this with our CAISO trader in the 
West. We are having significant confirmation problems with them.

Please do not turn them back on without speaking to me. 

Should anyone from Duke call you or the Help Desk regarding this issue - 
please have them call me directly on x 39477. 

Thanks for your help, 

Shari
