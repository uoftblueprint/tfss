After the Day ahead market ran, the COI branch group TTC in the (N-S)
direction was changed from 3800 MW to 4100 MW for HE's 1800 through 2400 for
operating day 7/26/01.  The reason for the change is for the Northwest
Generation Urgent pump repairs.  The first applicable Hour Ahead market to
run with these values is HE 1800.  The ISO will update you of any changes in
line rating status.  Sent by Market Operations, inquiries please call the
Hour Ahead Desk.

The system conditions described in this communication are dynamic and
subject to change.  While the ISO has attempted to reflect the most current,
accurate information available in preparing this notice, system conditions
may change suddenly with little or no notice.
