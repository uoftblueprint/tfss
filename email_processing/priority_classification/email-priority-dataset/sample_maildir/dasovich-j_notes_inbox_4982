Becky --

Can you please find out (a) details about the emergency expansion on Kern 
River and (b) key Firm Shippers on Kern River, Mojave, PGT?

Philip Allen called me this morning and asked about our ability to "get a 
read" on the potential for other Firm Shippers on Kern River to oppose this 
expansion.  Can we quietly reach out to our industry contacts (other Govt 
Affairs shops) to get their opinions?

His concern is primarily about Kern expanding into CA will limit other Firm 
Shippers given the limitations on the SoCal system [Jeff, give me a call to 
see how this plays in CA].  

While we are not a Firm Shipper (and we probably don't want to get directly 
in front of this - Enron fights expansion), how will FERC and its Staff look 
at this issue [Donna & Leslie}?

Let's try and have the info and a call on Thursday at 4pm Houston time to get 
back to him afterwards.

Jim
