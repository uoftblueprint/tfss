We had the legal call on Wednesday.  It was Mike, Kent and me. You didn't 
miss much.  They are waiting on us, and I didn't want to give them anything 
we hadn't discussed internally.

I asked Rose to have the Coyote Springs contract OBS'ed (off balance 
sheet-ed).  She should have something shortly. 

By the way, the contact sheet that Steve distributed was the one we prepared.

I'll catch you up on other stuff when you have time.  Nothing urgent...
