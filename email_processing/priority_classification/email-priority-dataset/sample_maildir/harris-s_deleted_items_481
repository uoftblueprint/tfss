Karon -- please order a Blackberry device and external charger for Steve ASAP.  Do you have one in stock or another pending order we could borrow and replace with Steve's order?  Thanks.  Jean

Jean, per our conversation on this afternoon, please place an urgent request for the purchase of a "Blackberry" Pager for Steve Harris.  Please include the outside charger.

Steve's EID# is 10006946, CC# 0060, CC# 111039

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention.
