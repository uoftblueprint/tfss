VERIFIABLE ERCOT MARKET PARTICIPANTS

ERCOT is considering setting up a special e-mail
"exploder" address list to use as supplemental
notification to registered participants in the
ERCOT market when Special Operating Condititons,
Advisories, Alerts and Emergency Operations
Procedures are implemented and posted on the SAMIS
(OASIS).

If you are a verifiable participant in the ERCOT
market and would like to be included in this list,
please notify John Tolbert Smith
(jsmith@ercot.com) by November 24, 2000.  It is
important that we have an address that will likely
be stable and not often changed.

To assist us in processing your reply you must set
the subject of your responce to "MARKET EMAIL" to
be included in this list.
