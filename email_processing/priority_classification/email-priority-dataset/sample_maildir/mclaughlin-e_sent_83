Subject: New EAST books

We have new book names in TAGG for our intramonth portfolios and it is 
extremely important that any deal booked to the East is communicated quickly 
to someone on my team.  I know it will take some time for the new names to 
sink in and I do not want us to miss any positions or P&L.  

Thanks for your help on this.

Scott Neal :         East Northeast
