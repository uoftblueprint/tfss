Attached is the lasted revised edition of the Emergency Call List for Enron Center and the Ardmore Data Center. Please review any areas that relate to you or your group for accuracy. Please forward any needed revision or addition requests to me via e-mail. Please do not make changes to the spreadsheet. Your assistance is appreciated.

Thanks,
