Date: Fri, 8 Dec 2000 06:16:00 -0800 (PST)
From approximately 4 - 4:15pm today, our network connection with Houston will 
be down.   Any applications that rely on Houston servers will not function 
during this time, for example:
Lotus Notes
Web Browser
Any remote applications run from Houston

Please make sure you close out of these types of applications before 3:55pm, 
or you may lose data. 

Your Microsoft Office applications, however,  will not be effected during 
this outage unless you are accessing files from Houston. 

Remember, if you are located in Houston, the reverse is true.  Any Omaha 
resources you normally access will not be available during this time.  

If you have questions, please contact the Help Desk at Omaha, x7454 / Houston
