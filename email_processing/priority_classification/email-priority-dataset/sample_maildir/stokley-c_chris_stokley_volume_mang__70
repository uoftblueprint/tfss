Dear Houston Settlements,

Hope your Monday is going well.  Busy, but well (I hope).

As I am observing this Holy Week of Silence, I ask that you send all correspondence by e-mail. 
Please feel free to call me by phone when something would be better explained spokenly or when you have an urgent need, but I ask that all other correspondence from you or our counterparties be in writing this week.

Thank you for your understanding,

Virginia
