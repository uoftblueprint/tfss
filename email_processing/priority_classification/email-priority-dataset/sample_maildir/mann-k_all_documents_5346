Sheila/Kay-

Would either of you please give me a call at your earliest convenience.  I 
urgently need to write a change order for the LM6000 contract with S&S/GE for 
some additional TDofI hours so that they don't pull the plug on me in the 
field (or at least that's what they're threatening to do).  

Please call me at x54683.  If you don't get in touch with me today, I will be 
in Austin tomorrow and can be reached at (713) 412-6873 (c).

Thanks,
Eric Booth
