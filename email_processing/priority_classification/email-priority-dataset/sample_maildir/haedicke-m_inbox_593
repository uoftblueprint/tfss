Mark, 
re. the above, we are working on a significant number of divestments (very important transactions for cashflow reasons totalling potentially over 500MM US) in Europe that are likely triggers; I urgently need to address this with you guys - Michael Brown wants me to sort out a waiver letter / procedure before the weekend. Can't get a hold of Lance. Could you or Lance give me a shout this morning. 
Thanks, Marcus
