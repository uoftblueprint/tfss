# Email Priority Dataset

## Introduction
This dataset categorizes emails based on their priority levels. Labels in `labels.csv` are generated by GPT-4.

## Priority Levels

### 1. Urgent (Immediate Action Required)
  - Explicit mentions of immediate action, crisis, emergency, or significant negative consequences if not addressed promptly.
  - Phrases implying critical impact on operations, safety, or essential functions. Imminent deadlines within hours or very short terms are mentioned.
  - Indicates that a response or action is required as soon as possible, ideally within the same working day.

### 2. High (Blockers, ASAP/Same-day Response)
  - Discussions of obstacles or issues impacting ongoing projects or operations that require a timely decision or input.
  - Mentions of approaching deadlines, time-sensitive decisions, or fast-approaching meetings where input or action is crucial.
  - Suggests a need for a response or action by the end of the day or within 24 hours.

### 3. Medium (Timely Response Required)
  - Routine business inquiries, updates on ongoing projects, requests for information not indicated as urgent.
  - Standard office communications, coordination emails, or follow-ups on previous discussions.
  - No explicit or implied rush, suggesting a response is expected within a reasonable but not immediate timeframe (2-3 days).

### 4. Low (Non-Urgent/Casual)
  - General information, newsletters, non-urgent updates, casual check-ins, or social invitations related to work.
  - Language indicating that the content is informative or optional rather than necessary for immediate business processes.
  - No immediate response required or expected, can be attended to as per convenience.

### 5. None (Promotional)
  - Promotional material, advertisements, unsolicited sales pitches, or clearly non-personalized mass emails.
  - Lack of personalization, generic marketing language, offers, or invitations not directly related to immediate work needs.
  - Generally does not require a response or attention unless of specific personal or professional interest.
