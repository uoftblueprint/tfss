"Dearest Cheryl - You are so good at what you do. I was reminded of it this morning when I heard you on NPR. You're the perfect person to be on the ground dealing with the operation and also translating for the public what is going on. I know you don't enjoy doing press, but you are very good at it and I think it is important for the American public to understand the mission of the U.S. government and the high respect and deference you are giving to the Haitian government. You really got that across this morning. Sending you lots of love and good luck in your incredibly important mission. xo, Ann", 5

The video has over 110,000 views on youtube already, and she is likely to touch many more people as it spreads.

"Jake You may remember that I called on you early in the Administration on the UN statement on sexual orientation. You were tremendous as was the Secretary. This request is not in keeping with the regular hierarchy, but I had to send it. The video the Secretary did is extraordinarily powerful. Can you let her know that individual employees in the building appreciate what she has been doing on LGBT rights? I know GLIFFA will do so, but it's kind of their job to advocate. But if you could just tell her in a minute how deeply her work is touching us in the trenches, well, it's something I think she deserves to hear. http://www.youtube.com/user/statevideo#Wa/u/0/ABoW8GCDtY Lynn M.

JoDee Winterhof raised questions about how the PRTs and the language DOD uses about them are problematic for NGOs like care. Pls ask one of Holbrooke's people if they ever talked to Wolfgang Danspeckgruber at Princeton about building a railroad in Afghanistan. Also Dr. Arthur Keys at International Relief + Development wanted to talk w someone from Holbrooke's team about development in Af.
