Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.    My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time. ;True

Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?  San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.  Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now.  If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will know more on this question later today.  Sincerely,  George W.

It appears that a single  buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above  market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,  offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were  bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index  calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated  financial swaps for San Juan.   We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.    2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that  are dramatically different.    I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.   It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Crocker""  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

Crocker""  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the ""fiscals"".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

Limited partnership? General partner?   What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what  capacity(regarding ownership and   liabilities)?   Who owns the land? improvements?   Who holds the various loans?   Is the land collateral?   Investment    What happens to initial investment?   Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?    Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?   When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment  schedule?   Investment Return   Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?   Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits  are distributed?   Debt   Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral  is associated with each   loan?   Improvement   Construction   Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.   Terms of each loan?   Uses of Funds   How will disbursements be made?  By whom?   What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing  for investors?   Reports to track expenses vs plan?   Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?   What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get  paid a markup on subcontractors as a   general contractor and paid gain out of profits?   Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses  before the ultimate payout of profits?   Design and Construction    When will design be complete?   What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?   What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction  planning and permitting?   Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors,  vendors, and other professionals?   Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?   Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to  use? Names?  These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor  in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process.

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.

22;To: cbpres@austin.rr.com;phillip.allen@enron.com;Tue, 19 Sep 2000 07:26:00 -0700 (PDT);; George,   Here sales numbers from Reagan:        As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The  1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the  units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units  under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with  competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals  actually done to date.      Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call  about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was  rejected on the De Ville property.  Phillip Allen           ;True

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were  built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for   around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated  that he had more units under construction that would be   available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different  from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor  plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.     As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.

The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region's growing number of dot-coms.                          Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                   original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com.                          Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle.                   More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                   equipment of the Internet economy.                          It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites.                         Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                   facilities.                          ""We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,""  said Karl                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. ""That is                   the equivalent of six oil refineries.""                          A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads.                          Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. The                   tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                   the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                   Karzmar said.                          Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                          For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                   region, this is a new and complex issue.                          On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. The  facilities run 24 hours a                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures.                          Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to debate.                          ""These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads,"" said Bob Royer,                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light.                          ""The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.  We have data                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts.""                          With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                   one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                   Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                   six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies.                          ""It is probably the largest data center park in the  country,"" boasts Laurent                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG  Communications,                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                   lease space in the office park.                          After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole  claims his firm is                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country.                          As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                   Seattle continues to escalate.                          But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center  space is growing at a                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California.                          Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year.  While companies                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management.                          ""We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                   than data center space,"" said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                   Seattle.                          The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                   industry perplexed.                          ""It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,""                   said Seattle City Light's Royer. ""The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                   a way.""          ";True

Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:   (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS  X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share    That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think  crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.   Current price 37  Nat. Gas 34  Crude  10   Total  81     Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?

He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.  On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.

I think  I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from  him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some  price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large  enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.   The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage  the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.  Phillip;True

The  WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,  which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes  the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but  there can be a siginificant difference between ""scheduled"" and ""actual""  generation.  You are pulling ""scheduled.""  If someone doesn't schedule their  generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you  will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california  munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side.  On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the ""scheduled"" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.  I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with  others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas  demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,  especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the  UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal  consumer then it is obviously a different story.  Let's talk. ";True

The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.  Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.  I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be  an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is  O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to  get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and  I'll take care of it..  On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate  curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of  $235,019.    (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your  overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects  something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal  #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.   139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to  GDP-Kingsgate.   Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five  different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for  withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a  Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is  that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport  losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.   I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a  systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems  that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,  the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the  detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it  appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be  an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar  impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in  case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the  volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to  discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to  gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.   Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are  typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?   How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main  contacts at SW Gas?  We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our  control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably  have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the  commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their  commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)  should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month  index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That  risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of  their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.  As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are  there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly  appreciated.  Thanks,  Laird   ;True

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly ""unwilling to fight"" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would ""double dip"" into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would ""eat"" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.  ";True

I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is  even desired or necessary.  As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try  and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working  and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet  just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a  round table discussion format.

Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60  existed at the time of this bid.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that  the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large  part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which  the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman  began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or  answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had  some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce  demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would  export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty  strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner  out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and  if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the  agenda.  Hope this info helps.

From:  Stephen Swain                           04/10/2001 11:58 AM 	  To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt  Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, Chris  Mallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill Williams  III/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECT  Subject: CAISO demand reduction  Phillip et al.,  I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in  the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.  March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand  over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for  temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates  into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as  compared with the previous year.  Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary  reductions (as opposed to ""forced"" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other  forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making  total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.   This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple  more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the  retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it  is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last  year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in  Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation  are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of  meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general  economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least  make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.  Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area  only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC  (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO  portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in  demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As  you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum  smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at  least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its  wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several  mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are  sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly  how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.   Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's  economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of  the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I  think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already  realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the  non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the  WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around  6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.  I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you  with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I  hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any  questions or need any further information. ";True

However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned  I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get  back in touch with you once he is finished.  Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager  from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable  with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp  Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid  for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am  still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local  relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final  determination on unit mix and site plan.  Phillip Allen;True

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new  building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being  offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.  This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the  new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The  cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is  currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly  employee cost of $94.00.  If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to  the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made  as spaces become available.   The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be  opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street  level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available.  Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an  exit in the event of elevator trouble.   If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to  Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your  email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and  receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new  garage.  The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and  Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.   (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians,  will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)          ;True
100;To: rlehmann@yahoo.com;phillip.allen@enron.com;Thu, 29 Mar 2001 03:59:00 -0800 (PST);; Reagan,  I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.  Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?  What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA  221(d) loans?    Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market  quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:    5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment   2%- overhead   4%- profit  I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an  extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even  reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only  generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about  such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down  to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?  I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you  local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of  the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.  Phillip      ;True

Below is a  list of questions on the specs:  1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less  and cost about the same?  2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory  joist?  3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?  4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What  type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or  Cellulose?  5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?  6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know  the difference between an apron and a stool.  7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent  cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?  8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial  one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.  9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under  the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.  10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount  stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.  11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.  12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?  13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?  14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron  railings?  15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except  for change orders?  I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but  this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to  call Cary Kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.  Phillip I   ;True

My only comment is that George and Larry might  object to the language that ""the bank that was requested to finance the  construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs  of the construction of the Project"".   Technically, that bank lowered the  loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of  equity that would be required.   Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.  Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans,  engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are  in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking  directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on  what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.    The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we  need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and  give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.  Phillip";True

The kids are on spring break.  I will be in San Marcos and you  can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com.  I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a  check and give him the green light to file for replatting.  What will change  if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change  what he is going to submit to the city.  I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the  soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the  week.  I don't know who needs this report.  I told Gordon you might call to  inquire about what work he performed. His number is 512-930-5832.  We spoke on the phone about most of these issues.  Talk to you later.  Phillip;True

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.  Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however.  More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter. ";True

I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is  still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot  and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a  topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to  coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the  smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going  to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to  complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which  $14,000 are due now for work completed.    We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by  the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can  continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's  number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and  ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call  and he was fine with that.    Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp  Flores can be used.  Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very  optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.  Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about  moving this project forward.  Phillip;True

He  wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.    We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to  determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect  work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation  for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were  proposing was unsupportable by the market.    My version of a buyout is attached.  I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to  foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?   Since their cost and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I  wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I  want to respond to their offer asap.  Call me with your thoughts.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about  500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,  this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000.  I have summarized our issues as follows:  1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:       Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417  2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over.  3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).  4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x  debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.  5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.  6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:       Land -                   $1,121,670      Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000      Cash Equity              $1,419,268      Total                    $2,955,938  7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage  of actual hard construction costs.  (See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)      - MAPTTRA.xls ";True

I still have the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 million.  The components are as follows:       Unit Cost, Site work, &      builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million       Land                      1.15       Interim Financing               .85       Common Areas                     .80       Total                         $10.4  Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.  After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.  Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to  discuss alternatives.  Phillip    ;True

Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)  will be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal.  3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable.  Thanks,  Andrew Ozuna Real Estate Loan Officer 210-271-8386 ##   ;True

Their version includes the salary of a  superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third  party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of ""construction management""  fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be  paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally  the builders profit of 1.4 million.  Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out  of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if  they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?   We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition  to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been  in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and  the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management  fee is included.  George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will  review and let you know what I think.  The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to  the 3 out 4 approval process.  Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only  true costs + 1.4 million.  Phillip ";True

The key business points are:  1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate  2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million  3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.  4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?  5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.  With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a  solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes  costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I  would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax  all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the  checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing  but invoices were not being submitted.  Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some  tweaking.    Phillip Allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com  ;True

Therefore, I could take a  sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only  require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I  would net around $20K cash.    You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or  higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the  New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.   Phillip;True
132;To: jsmith@austintx.com;phillip.allen@enron.com;Tue, 6 Feb 2001 01:01:00 -0800 (PST);; Jeff,  I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4  years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several  reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the  large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer  are the three biggest concerns.    What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the  buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due  until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the  property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make  the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance  is pushing too far.  Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the  earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?  Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New  Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get  started on the list.  Email or call  me later today.  Phillip   ;True

135;To: jsmith@austintx.com;phillip.allen@enron.com;Wed, 31 Jan 2001 08:20:00 -0800 (PST);Re: The Stage; Jeff,  Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.  1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and  repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor  cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on  repairs.  2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite  manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has  interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager  that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a  management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager  onsite.  3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you  want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.  4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure  this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.  My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property  definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.   Sales Price  705,000  1st Lien   473,500  2nd Lien  225,000  Transfer fee    7,500  Cash required   14,500   NOI   100,000  1st Lien    47,292  2nd Lien   23,694  Cash flow  29,014  Cash on cash  200%   These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then  cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the  additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years  for a higher price.  Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.  Phillip ;True

Cash Needs Highlights: SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20 available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. II. Credit Relationships Highlights: SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. III. Energy Cost Scenarios Highlights This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=  such=20 scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. IV. Cost Containment Initiatives Highlights SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 Capital Improvement Costs                383 Total                                             $ 460 The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20 Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20 Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s= =20 Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th= e=20 end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20 D.01-01-018. Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the TRA, are overstated. TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU= RN=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=  the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the TRA is overstated. VI. Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a= =20 positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its= =20 shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm= on=20 stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati= ve=20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. [there is no Section VII] =20 VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500= =20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20 In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.= =20 This increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.  Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626   Phillip     ;True

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially  complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with  the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would ""retain"" $106 million (of  what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who  switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the  QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December  (and maybe earlier).  PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the  Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get  some assurances of payment.   SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due  on 2/2/01.  For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's  purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements  (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be  resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this  occurred today.  Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will  happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.   Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is  dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.   ";True

He should have paid  260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He  either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the  middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a  big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.  Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent  you this morning.  Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.    Phillip;True
